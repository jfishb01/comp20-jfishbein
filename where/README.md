Josh Fishbein         Comp 20         Assignment 3

All components of this project have been implemented correctly. All redline 
stations with the line are drawn on the map. The redline stations use a
non-default marker. Clicking on a redline station opens an infowindow with
the northbound and southbound train schedule. The user is shown on the map.
When the user is clicked, the latitude and longitude are displayed. Waldo
and Carmen Sandiego are also displayed. When they are clicked, the distance
between them and the user is displayed in an info-window along with
their coordinates. The distance between the user and the nearest T-Station
is displayed in a box on top of the bottom left corner of the map.

I collaborated with Sean Harrington, Ben Leiken, Scott Owades, and Kenny
Cohen.

I spent approximately 15 hours on this assignment.
