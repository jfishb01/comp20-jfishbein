Josh Fishbein		Comp 20			Assignment 2

All components of this assignment have been correctly implemented. I correctly
created the gameboard using a canvas. This gameboard includes all the
neccessary components (logs, cars, lives, etc.). I created this using the
the sprite sheet image. This was all done in javascript. I also created an
initialization function. The values created in this function are used in
creating the gameboard.

I discussed this assignment with Scott Owades.

I spent about 8 hours on this assignment
