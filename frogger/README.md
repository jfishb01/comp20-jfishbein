Josh Fishbein		Comp 20			Assignment 4

All components of this assignment have been correctly implemented.
The game loads immediately on page load. When an arrow key is pressed,
frogger moves about the screen in the appropriate direction. Vehicles and
logs have been animated on the screen. Collision detection allows frogger
to be hit by the cars and jump on the logs. Game scoring has also
been implemented according to the game guidelines.

In addition to the required features, I also implemented three additional
features.
- When frogger dies by drowning, jumping off the screen, or
getting hit by a car, the dead frogger image is briefly displayed.
- When frogger moves, a moving sound is played. When frogger dies,
a different dying sound is displayed.
- After jumping 5 frogs home, the game level is incremented so that
all the vehicles move faster.

I spent about 15 hours on this assignment.
