Josh Fishbein		Comp 20		Lab 7

All components of this lab have been correctly implemented.
JSON data was retrieved from the web API using AJAX.
The javascript code then adds the appropriate elements within the
body tag using the JSON associated array. No tags were added
inside the body tag of jobs.html.

This lab took approximately 0.5 hours.
